# escape-the-dragon
Referred to as "Escape".

This project was designed to test my knowledge and skill with javascript at a beginner level. Escape was actually designed second, with another javascript game (The Cave) serving as the intermeadiate project. 
There are no current plans for a hard project as I don't know what skills I'm missing to use in the hard project.
