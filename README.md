# escape-the-dragon
Referred to as "Escape".

This project was designed to test my knowledge and skill with javascript at a beginner level. Escape was actually designed second, with another javascript game (The Cave) serving as the intermeadiate project. 
There are no current plans for a hard project as I don't know what skills I'm missing to use in the hard project.

To keep everything in one place, I will enter some in-general notes below:

locations:
0 - entrance
1 - large cavern
2 - hidden room
3 - tunnel of biolumenence
4 - rock wall
5 - underground river
6 - old campsite
7 - bat cave
8 - old tracks
9 - sorta old tracks
10 - bone room
11 - old carving
12 - week old tracks
13 - dark room
14 - newer tracks
15 - cave painting
16 - fresh tracks
17 - treasure hoard
18 - dragon room <--start here
19 - dead end
20 - lose
21 - win
22 - mini game
23 - death bone room

double check the restart function maybe?
beware infinite loops? ex: restart -> dragon room -> restart

need to switch the south and west buttons for all locations (due to rose compass issues)
